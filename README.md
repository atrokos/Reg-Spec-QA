The code in this repository is split into multiple branches. Each branch reflects work of a different team member. We decided to keep the codes split in this way to avoid merge conflicts and preserve the project's history.

For the evaluation scripts, check the `karel/eval` branch. For scripts that run the models, the most updated code is on the `ondra/playground` and `marek/isplayingaround` branches.
